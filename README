Running this configuration you need some extra applications installed

I am using Arch Linux.
Between names and descirption, there are two kind lines like, - and --
- means you can download by pacman -S
-- means you can download by yaourt -S

i3-config
Edit what you don't need! like #statup area!

i3 bar conky:
alsa-utils - for Volume
light-git -- for Display Brightness
ttf-font-awesome -- fonts may need
